# ATP-Project-PartA
Maze Project, in Java, Part A+B.
In this project we created a maze generator, using Prim's algorithm. We also added the maze solution option, using BFS,DFS or Best First Search algorithms.
In the second part, we took care on client-server connection, and compressing the maze while sending it to server.
